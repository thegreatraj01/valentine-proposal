# ❤️ Be My Valentine - The "Yes" Trap

**Live Demo:** [https://valentine-proposal-26.netlify.app/](https://valentine-proposal-26.netlify.app/)

A playfully interactive Valentine's invitation web page designed to make saying "No" practically impossible.

## ✨ Features

- **The Slippery "No" Button:** Using coordinate-based distance tracking, the "No" button detects the cursor and glides away before it can be clicked.
- **"Chee" Text Cascade:** An automated falling text effect that triggers "Cheeeeeeeeeeee🤧" whenever the user attempts to click "No."
- **Trail of Sadness:** As the "No" button moves, it leaves a falling `😢` emoji in its wake exactly once every second.
- **The Grand Reveal:** \* Clicking **Yes** hides the entire invitation form.
  - The background blurs out using a smooth CSS transition.
  - A celebratory kissing bear GIF is displayed to seal the deal.
- **Dynamic Visuals:** Floating heart animations and a custom SVG heart favicon.
